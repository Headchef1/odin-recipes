      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is one of my favorite hamburger recipes. You can substitute bleu,
        gorgonzola, or feta for the Roquefort cheese.
      </p>
      <p>Don't forget the American fries!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1 Bun</li>
        <li>
          Prepared meat patty. Approximately 125-200 grams. You can make it out
          of grounded meat or buy a ready to go one in a grocery.
        </li>
        <li>1 cut of red onion</li>
        <li>Couple iceberg salad leaves</li>
        <li>1 Tomato</li>
        <li>1 Pickled cucumber</li>
        <li>1-2 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>BBQ souse</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Before start baking, prepare all ingredients. Slice tomatoes, pickles,
          cheese, onion. Wash salad leaves, and can chop them to fit in to a bun
        </li>
        <li>Heat up a pan, if you cook at home, or prepare a grill</li>
        <li>
          Bake buns on a pan or grill for a minute or less to make it a bit
          crispy. Try not to overcook it or burn them. When buns are ready, turn
          off the heat but don't hide the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place all ingredients starting from the bottom bun. Salad, tomato,
          pickles, onion
        </li>
        <li>On the top bun spill some souse</li>
        <li>Baking patty:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Bake it on each side for 1 min flipping it over</li>
          <li>You can dress it up with some pepper and oregano</li>
          <li>
            After each side backed for 1 min, continue to bake each side for 2
            more minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            For las several seconds put cheese slices on patty for it to start
            melting
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Take patty of the pan ot grill and place it on prepared bun</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Sum up</h2>

      <p>
        And that should be it. If you have fries for garnish you can add them
        for full meal.
      </p>
      <p>Such easy recipe will make you a king of a grill this evening.</p>
