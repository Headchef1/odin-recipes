      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>It's easy, it's cheesy, and it's vegetarian!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart
          casserole dish with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in
          the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but
          firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just
          below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach,
          cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain spinach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg,
          basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole
          dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/4
          cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta
          mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 lasagna noodles
          and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and
          Parmesan cheese on top. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and
          continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about
          25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.
