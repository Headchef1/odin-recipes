In this assignment I work on creating my HTML pages and using skill obtained earlier in Odin Project basics. Topic of an assignment is recipe of a dish.
Here is what I do in assignment:

- I create main index.html file.
- Create subfolder with .html files.
- Link multiple pages from other folders in main pages.
- Structurising and organizing source code of my page.
- Constantly use Git to update my adds and commits to become more comfortable using it
